ESP32 based ultrasonic motion detector with OLED visual and buzzer alerts. Built as a learning project to explore IoT sensors and real-time data visualization.

STATUS: In development

Features
- Ultrasonic distance: HC‑SR04 measures range up to 400 cm  
- Device scanning: Servo motor sweeps sensor through 180°  
- OLED dashboard: SSD1306 OLED Display shows live distance, angle, and alerts  
- Buzzer alerts: Continuous tone when an object is detected within threshold
- Data logging: Records timestamp, distance, and servo angle to an SD card in CSV format
